# Skill Swap
## User stories
    - As a user I can filter results so that I can increase my chances of finding a profile I would like to exchange skills with.
    - As a user I can add an image to my profile so that I am able to distininguish myself from other profiles, show that I am easy to get along with or demonstrate seriousness.
    - As a user I can handle recieved requests accordingly, delete pending requests as well as un match with current matches if I happen to change my mind.
    - As a user I can sleep knowing my personal details are secure and only viewed by profiles I matched with.
