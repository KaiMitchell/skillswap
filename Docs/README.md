# Skill Swap
## User stories
    - As a user I want to be able to browse the website without having an account so that I can skip the hassle of signing up.
    - As a user I only want to be prompted to "sign up" when trying to access member only features.
    - As a user I want to be able to search for a skill I can teach and can learn and be shown results that match my searches so that I can narrow the results.
    -As a user if no results are a match in a search I want profiles dislaying similar (same category) skills to my search to be rendered so that I don't have to keep searching untill my search input hits.
    - As a user I would like to be able to edit my profile so that I can update my skill preference.
    - As a user I want to be able to search for skills via a drop-down as an alternative to typing the skill to eliminate the thought process of "what is a skill".
